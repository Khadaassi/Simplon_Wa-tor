## Project Structure

This project consists of the following main Python files:

- **main.py**: The entry point of the simulation. This file initializes the world and starts the simulation.
- **fish.py**: Contains the `Fish` class, which defines the behavior and properties of fish in the simulation.
- **shark.py**: Contains the `Shark` class, which models shark behaviors and their interactions with fish.
- **world.py**: Manages the environment where the simulation takes place, including the creation of water bodies and the positioning of fish and sharks.
- **display.py**: Responsible for rendering the simulation visuals, showing the aquatic life in action.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the main script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
## Outputs

The simulation produces various visual outputs that demonstrate the interactions between fish and sharks. Below are some sample images generated by the simulation:
